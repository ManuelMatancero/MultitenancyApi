# Manage-Clients-SpringBoot
In this project I use many of the features of Spring and Spring Boot such as Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, Spring Data, Spring Security, Validations, Internationalization, Spring with Hibernate/JPA and others.
# How to run 
First of all you have to have a jdk version 11 or later to be able to run the project. In the configuration of the project you have to setup the version of JDK to the 
one you have installed in Source and Compile options.
# Database Schema
In this project I use MYSQL 8 for the database. You have to create a database called test or the name you prefer but remember set the name of the database in the file application.properties and do the same with 
username and password depending of the credentials you use to acces to the SQL workbench.
