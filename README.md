# Multitenancy Application

This is an example of how to create a multitenancy application using Spring data JPA, for this project I use PgAdmin4 to create the databases tenant1 and tenant2 with the same structure and the following query:

# create table employee (id int8 generated by default as identity, name varchar(255), primary key (id));

# How to run
You should clean and build the project and update the credentials to access the databases in the allTenants folder the application.properties ones.
